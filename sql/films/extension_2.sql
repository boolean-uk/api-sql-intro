Insert a few director records (the data does not need to be real, you can just make directors up). Re-insert your film data, updating each film with have a directorId.

-- I would like you to teach me how to program a user authentication feature using React, Express, and PostgreSQL. Specifically, I want to learn how to implement authentication through email, social media platforms like Gmail, Twitter, and Facebook, as well as authentication via text messages. The authentication process should include functionalities such as signup, login, password reset, and password recovery. Additionally, for email authentication, users should receive a verification code in their email to complete registration and password recovery. Furthermore, the implementation should cover setting up a refresh token and incorporating other essential features required for a modern authentication system.
